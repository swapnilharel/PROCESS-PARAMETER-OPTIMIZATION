# PROCESS-PARAMETER-OPTIMIZATION
● Objective was to optimize input parameters i.e. Spindle speed, Feed, Depth of cut, Orientation of cut and inclination to obtain superior Surface Integrity. ● Experimentation was conducted at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay on HARDINGE VMC 600 II. ● Designed and fabricated a fixture to hold the job in cantilever position and develop compatibility between VMC machine and Job using SolidWorks. ● The data after experiment was analyzed using data analysis softwares like ANOVA and MINITAB. ● Used L8 Orthogonal array proposed by Taguchi for Process parameter optimization.  ● The project enhanced our knowledge of Process Parameter optimization and nurtured our design for manufacturing concepts.  Tools and Equipment: HARDINGE VMC 600 II, Deflection Sensor ,Surface Roughness Tester(MitutoyosurftestSJ-301).  Softwares and Technologies: Minitab, ANOVA, SolidWorks, Matlab.
